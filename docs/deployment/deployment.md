# Deployment

This guide describes how to deploy your app on your live domain. The setup consists of two parts.

1. Register the app in your plentysystems system. Registering the app generates authentication credentials.
2. Add the credentials to your GitHub repository.
3. Upload the app to plentysystems.

The following sections describe the steps in detail.

## plentysystems system

1. Log into your plentysystems system.
2. Go to **CMS » Deployment**.
3. Click on :plus: to add a new application.
4. Fill in the required information.
5. **Create** the application.

Creating the application adds a new table entry. In the next part, you'll need the following value:

- **Access key**

3. In the **All workflows** sections, click on **Deploy PWA**.
4. Open the **Run workflow** drop-down menu.
5. In the field **The tag version, branch name or SHA to checkout**, enter the name of the branch you want to deploy.
6. Click on **Run workflow**.

The workflow takes several minutes to complete. You can monitor the progress in the **Actions** menu.

## Activation

1. Log into your plentysystems system.
2. Go to **CMS » Deployment**.
3. For the configured domain, open the further actions menu (three dots).
4. Click on **Activate application**.

The activation makes the application reachable on the configured domain.
It can take up to 1 hour for the changes to take effect.
