# Introduction

This page provides general information about how to handle the style guide.

## Prefer automation

The style guide should only consist of guidelines we can't automate. It's always preferable to update the ESLint configuration or add a custom script over adding a rule to the style guide.

## Link instead of duplicate

If you want to draw attention to a part of the Vue or Nuxt documentation, link the relevant section instead of copy-pasting it.
