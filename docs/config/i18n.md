# I18N configuration

## Locales

The i18n configuration affects language and currency. It's important that the app's configuration matches the settings of the system [you connect to](middleware.md). Otherwise, you'll receive incorrect data or data in the wrong language.

- The locale settings have to match the plentysystems system settings.
- The `fallbackLocale` and `defaultLocale` have to match the system default language.

Configure the app in [`i18n.config.ts`](../../apps/web/i18n.config.ts) and [`nuxt.config.ts`](../../apps/web/nuxt.config.ts).

## Translations

You can find translation files for different languages in the `apps/web/lang` folder. Each language has its own file.
