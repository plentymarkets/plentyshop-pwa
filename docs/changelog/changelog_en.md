### 🚀 New

#### Editor

- The homepage now supports improved block management. Users can add blocks via the side navigation while a new placeholder component indicates the future block position.
- On the technical side, block editing has been enhanced through dynamic block registration.
- Editing blocks now uses a forms. This means users no longer have to manipulate the underlying data structure directly.

#### Modules

- The project now features the newly integrated `shop-core` module, which enhances our system by enabling the seamless pushing of API events directly into the Core Module. This change enables communication between the base application and module extensions.
- The shop now integrates the Google Analytics module, `shop-module-gtag`, to enhance tracking capabilities. Additionally, users can opt out of non-essential cookies directly from the cookie bar, and the system now automatically removes cookies once consent is revoked.

#### Misc

- Added robots for static pages.
- Added a fallback text to the shipping page if none is configured.

### 👷 Changed

#### Package manager

We've switched our package manager from Yarn to NPM. There are two main reasons for this change:

1. NPM has better tools to audit and fix security vulnerabilities in the dependency tree than Yarn does.
2. NPM provides better tools for version management via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This matters because it allows us to consolidate apps created by different providers more easily.

**_IMPORTANT_**

- `yarn` commands have been replaced by their `npm` equivalent. For example, `yarn build` is now `npm run build`.
- Double check `.env.example` for updates. In particular, make sure to set a `DEFAULTLANGUAGE` in your environment.

#### Checkout

- The `Saved addresses` listing option is no longer available in the guest checkout flow.
- Incomplete PayPal setup will no longer throw an alert in the ui. The error is suppressed and only logged in the browser console.

#### Misc

- The build script now reads the configuration from the environment instead of fetching it from the remote system.
- The shop's color palette now gets generated at runtime instead of build time.

### 🩹 Fixed

- Fixed an issue where page elements changed during navigation.
- Fixed an issue where the site settings view was only displayed on the second click.
- Fixed an issue where the new block placeholder got displayed when editing the site settings.
- Fixed an issue where multiple sliders placed in one page ware not controlled independently via control arrows.
- Fixed slider navigation bullet points.
- Fixed accessibility errors in edit mode.
- Fixed default editor colors.
- Fixed the image-to-text ratio in the Image Text block, so that both now take up 50% of the available space.
- Fixed an index error on adding the first block.
- The first block on the page is now always displayed as an `h1` and all other blocks are displayed as `h2`.

## v1.9.1 (2025-01-29) <a href="https://github.com/plentymarkets/plentyshop-pwa/compare/v1.9.0...v1.9.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Overview of all changes</b></a>

### 📙 Todo

The production environment uses the GitHub Actions Secret `URL_ENDPOINT_TOKEN`; the staging environment uses the GitHub Actions Secret `URL_ENDPOINT_TOKEN_STAGING`.

### NPM Authentication Token

Instead of creating a `.yarnrc.yml` file manually, you can now use one of the following scripts depending on your operating system:

- Linux/MacOS: `yarn.sh` | `npm run setup:unix`
- Windows: `yarn.ps1` | `npm run setup:windows`

To run the script, you have to add your GitHub Token with `read:packages` permissions to the environment.

# apps/web/.env

NPM_AUTH_TOKEN="<TOKEN>"
```
